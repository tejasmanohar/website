I enjoy crafting elegant software solutions to **real** problems. I believe in
maximizing **impact** by building great infrastructure and growing others.

I'm currently happily employed at [Segment](https://segment.com/), where I work on the
infrastructure behind [Sources](https://segment.com/sources) and
[Warehouses](https://segment.com/warehouses). If you're looking to join a
breakout startup tackling a Salesforce-sized market with tech giant engineering
challenges, contact me at _my first name [at] company website_.

Previously, I was the first (and later, lead) engineer at [AutoLotto](http://autolotto.com/)
under two non-technical co-founders. I took the product from inception to growth,
building a cross-platform team to help along the way. Before that, I interned at and contracted with a few companies, including
[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/), [Populr](https://populr.me/),
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), and [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/).
