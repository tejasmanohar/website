Hit me up about whatever! I'm usually nice and certainly don't bite.

If you require a response, please contact me via email at _"me" [at] this domain_
(without the quotes). If you'd like to send me an encrypted message, see my
[Keybase profile](https://keybase.io/tejasmanohar).

If you're in the Bay Area and like my work, let's meet up!

## Warning

Due to time constraints, sometimes, I ignore certain emails.
Don't take it personally.
- **Open source.** You're more likely to get help (maybe even from me!)
via GitHub, StackOverflow, IRC, etc.
- **Typical gigs.** I'm not interested in joining just another company as
just another developer. I'm very happy and would need to find a new _class_ of
opportunity to consider a move at this time (e.g. academia, entrepreneurship,
leadership, something _new_).
